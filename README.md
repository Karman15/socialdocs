Telepresence through texting. We try to simulate human conversation by making a "real-time" text chat that immediately sends out every keystroke a user makes.

## How to get setup:

1. Install node dependencies: npm install
2. Start the server: npm start
3. Go to localhost:3000


Main files to mess around with are socketAPI.js (server) and chat.js (client)
